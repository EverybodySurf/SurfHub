This directory contains historical documentation that has been superseded by newer, more comprehensive guides.

## üìù **Why These Are Archived**

The following documents have been **consolidated into the main [`COMPREHENSIVE_SURF_FORECAST_GUIDE.md`](../COMPREHENSIVE_SURF_FORECAST_GUIDE.md)**:

### üåä **Marine Data & API Integration**
- [`MARINE_DATA_INTEGRATION.md`](./MARINE_DATA_INTEGRATION.md) - Original marine data integration notes
- [`OPEN_METEO_INTEGRATION.md`](./OPEN_METEO_INTEGRATION.md) - Open-Meteo specific integration documentation

### ü§ñ **Forecasting System**
- [`SMART_FORECASTER_SUMMARY.md`](./SMART_FORECASTER_SUMMARY.md) - Smart forecaster architecture overview
- [`SURF_ALGORITHMS_GUIDE.md`](./SURF_ALGORITHMS_GUIDE.md) - Surf quality algorithm documentation

### üßπ **Development Notes**
- [`SWELL_FORECAST_CLEANUP.md`](./SWELL_FORECAST_CLEANUP.md) - Historical cleanup notes for swell forecast system

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**

**Do not use these archived documents for current development**. They contain outdated information and may reference deprecated approaches.

**Instead, use:**
- **[`COMPREHENSIVE_SURF_FORECAST_GUIDE.md`](../COMPREHENSIVE_SURF_FORECAST_GUIDE.md)** - Complete, up-to-date system documentation
- **[`development/SWELL_FORECAST_DOCUMENTATION.md`](../development/SWELL_FORECAST_DOCUMENTATION.md)** - Current technical implementation details

## üîç **When to Reference Archived Docs**

These documents are kept for:
- **Historical context** - Understanding how the system evolved
- **Migration reference** - Checking what was changed during consolidation
- **Debugging legacy issues** - Understanding previous implementation approaches
