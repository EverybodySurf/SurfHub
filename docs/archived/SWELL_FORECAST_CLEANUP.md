# Swell Forecast Code Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Unavailable Data Fields**
Commented out or removed fields that are not available in the free OpenWeatherMap API:
- UV index
- Moon phase information (moonrise, moonset, moon_phase, moon_illumination, is_moon_up)
- Tide information (tide_time, tide_height_mt, tide_type) 
- Marine/swell specific data (swell_ht_mt, swell_ht_ft, swell_dir, swell_dir_16_point, swell_period_secs)
- Water temperature (water_temp_c, water_temp_f)
- Significant wave height (sig_ht_mt)
- Detailed weather calculations (dewpoint, windchill, heatindex)

### 2. **Simplified Data Schema**
- Updated `SwellForecastOutputSchema` to only include data we actually have
- Cleaned up hourly forecast schema to remove marine-specific fields
- Added comments to indicate which fields are not available

### 3. **Updated AI Prompt**
- Changed from technical surf forecaster to friendly surf advisor
- Focused on available weather data: temperature, wind, precipitation, humidity, visibility
- Added clear disclaimer about data limitations
- Encouraged users to check local surf reports for wave and tide specifics
- Made the tone more conversational and helpful

### 4. **Cleaned Up Data Processing**
- Removed unused `calculateDewPoint` function
- Simplified hourly forecast data extraction
- Removed references to non-existent fields in data extraction
- Kept only essential weather data processing

### 5. **Updated Documentation**
- Updated file header to reflect current functionality
- Added clear notes about API limitations
- Updated function descriptions to match new scope

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Honest Expectations**: Users now know what data is available vs. what isn't
2. **Improved User Experience**: Friendly, helpful advice instead of technical jargon
3. **Reduced Confusion**: No more references to data we don't have
4. **Better Performance**: Less data processing and simpler schemas
5. **Maintainability**: Cleaner code without unused fields and functions

## Future Improvements

When better marine data sources become available, we can:
- Add back tide information from a dedicated tide API
- Include real swell data from surf-specific APIs
- Add water temperature from marine weather services
- Include UV index from weather services that provide it

## Current Functionality

The swell forecaster now provides:
- Weather-based surf advisories
- Wind analysis for surf conditions
- Temperature and comfort information
- Timing recommendations based on weather
- Friendly reminders to check local surf reports for complete conditions
