# üöÄ Turbopack Configuration for SurfHub

This project is configured to use Turbopack, Vercel's next-generation bundler that provides significantly faster development builds and hot reloads.

## ‚úÖ What's Configured

### 1. **Development Server**
- Turbopack is enabled by default for development (`npm run dev`)
- Custom Turbopack rules for optimized CSS and TypeScript processing
- Background compilation for faster startup times

### 2. **Available Scripts**
```bash
# Standard development with Turbopack
npm run dev

# Development with specific port
npm run dev:turbo

# Development with debugging enabled
npm run dev:debug

# Stable build with Turbopack
npm run build:turbo

# Standard production build
npm run build
```

### 3. **Helper Script**
Use the included helper script for common Turbopack operations:
```bash
# Start development server
./turbo-dev.sh dev

# Start with debugging
./turbo-dev.sh debug

# Build with Turbopack
./turbo-dev.sh build

# Show configuration info
./turbo-dev.sh info

# Clear cache
./turbo-dev.sh clear
```

### 4. **VS Code Integration**
- Pre-configured tasks for Turbopack development
- Background task for development server
- Build and debug tasks available in VS Code Command Palette

## üîß Configuration Details

### Next.js Config (`next.config.ts`)
```typescript
// Turbopack configuration (now stable in Next.js 15+)
turbopack: {
  resolveAlias: {
    '@': './src',
  },
},
```

**Note**: Turbopack has built-in support for TypeScript and CSS, so no external loaders are needed.

### Turbo Config (`turbo.json`)
- Optimized caching strategy
- Proper task dependencies
- Output configuration for builds

## üöÄ Performance Benefits

With Turbopack enabled, you should see:
- **~10x faster** cold starts
- **~700x faster** updates with Fast Refresh
- Significantly faster builds for large applications
- Better handling of CSS and asset processing

## üîç Monitoring Performance

To see Turbopack performance metrics:
1. Open browser dev tools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Look for faster compilation times in terminal output
4. Hot reloads should be nearly instantaneous

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Cache Issues
If you experience issues, clear the cache:
```bash
./turbo-dev.sh clear
# or
rm -rf .next
```

### Development Issues
Try the debug mode:
```bash
npm run dev:debug
```

### Build Issues
Use the standard webpack build if Turbopack build fails:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Loader Errors
**Issue**: `Cannot find module 'ts-loader'` or similar loader errors  
**Solution**: Turbopack has built-in support for TypeScript and CSS. Remove any custom loader configurations from `next.config.ts` as they're not needed and can cause conflicts.

## üîÑ Migration Notes

- All existing Next.js features work with Turbopack
- CSS Modules, Tailwind, and PostCSS are fully supported
- TypeScript compilation is handled by Turbopack
- Environment variables work as expected
