add a private/dashboard page for users who are signed in.

Now, you need to configure your Supabase project to redirect users to this new page (/auth/confirm-success) after they click the confirmation link in the email.

To do this, you'll need to go to your Supabase Dashboard:

Navigate to Authentication.
Click on Settings.
Under Site URL and Redirect URLs, add the full URL to your confirm-success page. For example, if your site URL is https://mysite.com, you would add https://mysite.com/auth/confirm-success to the Redirect URLs.

Swell Forecast/surf Report Todo:üëá

last message from Gemini:
The code is trying to safely extract the text content from the rawOutput using optional chaining (?.) and the find method.

The red underlines on content and part likely indicate that the TypeScript compiler doesn't know for sure that rawOutput will have a content property, or that the items within the content array will have a text property. This is a type safety issue.

The type of rawOutput is determined by the return type of swellForecastPrompt(input). The swellForecastPrompt is defined using ai.definePrompt, and the return type of ai.definePrompt (or rather, the result of calling the defined prompt) might be a generic type that doesn't guarantee the presence and structure of content in the way you're trying to access it.

To fix this, we need to provide more specific type information for rawOutput. If you know the expected structure of the AI's response, you can define an interface or type for it and then assert that rawOutput conforms to that type.

For example, if you expect rawOutput to have a content property that is an array of objects, where each object might have a text property, you could define a type like this:

interface AiResponse {
  content?: Array<{ text?: string; [key: string]: any }>;
  // Add other properties if the AI response has them
}


And then cast rawOutput to this type:

const rawOutput = await swellForecastPrompt(input) as AiResponse;


However, a potentially cleaner approach within the GenKit framework might be to leverage the output schema defined for the prompt. The swellForecastPrompt has output: { schema: SwellForecastOutputSchema }. GenKit might provide a way to get a typed output directly based on this schema, rather than manually parsing the text content.

Let's explore if there's a more idiomatic GenKit way to handle the prompt's output that respects the defined schema. If not, we can proceed with defining a type for the raw AI response.

Do you have any information about the exact structure of the object returned by swellForecastPrompt? Or shall I look into how GenKit handles prompt output with defined schemas?



continue debugging the swell forecast feature. Run get swell forecast and see what it says.

Work on fetching the data from the API route that calls getSwellForecast and then render the information on: src/app/swell-forecaster/page.tsx in a cool beautiful and user-friendly way.
